# London Bike Rides - Moving Average and Heatmap DashBoard - Tableau



## Data Used

**Data** - Kaggle Dataset with varying information on conditions during bike rides in London

**Data Cleaning & Analysis** - Python3 (Anaconda)

**Data Visualization** - Tableau

## Summary
End-to-end data analyst portfolio project where I gather data programmatically using the Kaggle API, then through data exploration, assessment, and manipulation (using the Pandas library in Python), use said data to create a dashboard in Tableau which uses running averages, activity heat (or density) maps, and other tools to display relevant statistics and data about bike rides in London within a user-variable time period.
